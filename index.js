/*Task 1: counterMaker()
  
  Study the code for counter1 and counter2, then answer the questions below.
  
  1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
  // Counter1 uses a local variable -count- as well as returns a function.  Counter 2 uses a global count variable and simply increments ath variable every time it is called. 
  
  2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
  Well, technically both are using closures.  All functions are closures because they access variables within their available scope.  Both function do this whether it is global or local. 
  However, Counter 1 uses a more common scenario for which closures are mentioned.  It has a function within a function, and when called returns a the result of the function inside of that function.  So
  uniquely here we can access a function inside of another function by calling the outer function.   
  
  3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would 
     counter2 be better?  
     Counter1 is better in most scenarios where you don't need to store data consistently to the variable.  Global variables take more cpu power and therfore if you don't need a global variable you should keep it local. 
     Counter2 is better for when you need to store data to that variable and make it available across other pages and functions.

  2. Receive the callback function `inning` from Task 2
  3. Receive a number of innings to be played
  4. Return an array where each of it's index values equals a string stating the
